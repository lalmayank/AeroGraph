## What it does

**Phase 1 - Core Tracing**
- Captures **prompts**, **responses**, **tool calls**, **agent handoffs**, and **errors** as normalized trace events
- Stores traces in a replay-safe, append-only SQLite store
- Visualizes traces as an interactive **trace graph** with payload inspection, failure highlighting, and playback timeline

**Phase 2 - Branching, Diff, and Loop Detection**
- **Fork traces**: create derived traces from any span (append-only, parent immutable)
- **Lineage navigation**: breadcrumb, sibling list, derivedFrom - navigate the branch tree in the UI
- **Deterministic diff**: compare two lineage-related traces with Myers diff; divergence highlighted on the graph
- **Loop detection**: automatically detects repeated sequences, recursive tool usage, and multi-agent handoff cycles

**Phase 2.5 - Advanced Observability**
- **LangGraph State Tracking**: Capture full LangGraph state snapshots at node transitions, track state evolution.
- **LCEL Streaming Telemetry**: Telemetry overlays for stream completion times, Time-to-First-Token (TTFT), and tokens-per-second metrics.
- **RAG Payload Inspection**: Explicit first-class support for viewing retrieval queries, source documents, and metadata scoring.
- **Human Checkpoints**: First-class handling of `interrupt` states and human-in-the-loop approvals.
- All outputs validated through shared contracts (`@aerograph/contracts`); no schema bypasses

## Repository structure

- `packages/contracts`: event schema + shared contracts (source of truth)
- `packages/sdk`: reference SDK for emitting normalized trace events (Node.js)
- `packages/adapter-langchain`: MVP adapter for LangChain workflows (Node.js)
- `packages/otel`: OpenTelemetry export/import bridge (Node.js)
- `python/aerograph-sdk`: reference SDK for emitting normalized trace events (Python)
- `python/aerograph-langchain`: MVP adapter for LangChain workflows (Python)
- `python/aerograph-otel`: OpenTelemetry export/import bridge (Python)
- `apps/collector`: trace ingest + SQLite storage + lineage/diff/analysis endpoints
- `apps/web`: interactive trace graph UI with lineage panel, diff overlay, and loop warnings
- `apps/demo`: demo emitter + Phase 2 smoke demo

## Development

Requirements: Node.js (LTS)

```sh
npm install

# Start collector (http://localhost:4317):
npm run dev -w apps/collector

# Start web UI (http://localhost:5173):
npm run dev -w apps/web

# Run tests:
npm test

# Build:
npm run build
```

### Updating Cross-Language Artifacts

If you modify contracts in `packages/contracts`, you must update the derived JSON schemas and Python models:

```sh
# 1. Export JSON Schemas
npm run schema:export -w packages/schema-exporter

# 2. Regenerate Python models
uv run python/aerograph-sdk/tools/generate_contracts.py
```

## Phase 2 Quick Start

```sh
# 1. Start collector
npm run dev -w apps/collector

# 2. Emit a demo trace
npx tsx apps/demo/src/demo.ts

# 3. Run the full Phase 2 smoke demo (fork → diff → analysis)
npx tsx apps/demo/src/phase2-demo.ts

# 4. Open UI
open http://localhost:5173
```

## Phase 2 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/events` | POST | Ingest trace events |
| `GET /v1/traces` | GET | List traces |
| `GET /v1/traces/:id` | GET | Get trace + meta |
| `POST /v1/traces/:id/fork` | POST | Fork a trace at a span |
| `GET /v1/traces/:id/lineage` | GET | Lineage graph |
| `GET /v1/traces/:aId/diff/:bId` | GET | Lineage-aware deterministic diff |
| `GET /v1/traces/:id/analysis` | GET | Loop warnings + failure analysis |

## OpenTelemetry Interoperability

AeroGraph provides a bidirectional OpenTelemetry (OTLP) bridge via `@aerograph/otel` (TypeScript) and `aerograph-otel` (Python).
- **Export**: Send AeroGraph traces to Jaeger, Datadog, or any OTLP-compatible backend.
- **Import**: Ingest external OTLP spans into the AeroGraph collector via the `POST /v1/otlp/traces` endpoint.




## Architecture

- **No distributed infrastructure**: no queues, no collectors, no Kubernetes - all local SQLite
- **Contract-first**: all API shapes defined in `@aerograph/contracts` (Zod); validated on every ingress/egress
- **Append-only**: events and lineage edges are never mutated; forking copies prefix events
- **Deterministic**: ordering, diff, and loop analysis produce the same result for the same input

## How Aerograph compares

Aerograph is a cognitive observability and debugging layer for autonomous AI workflows, not an execution or orchestration engine.

### The core difference

| Tool | The core question it answers | The developer's UX |
|---|---|---|
| `trigger.dev` / `inngest.com` | How do we reliably execute and orchestrate this workflow at scale? | Infrastructure logs, queue states, retry schedules, and execution backbones. |
| `LangSmith` / `LangChain` | How is my LLM app performing, and what did this specific prompt cost/trace to? | Structured telemetry, prompt logs, token counts, and LLM evaluation datasets. |
| `Aerograph` | Why did my autonomous agents just make that decision? | A visual, replayable graph of reasoning paths, context drift, and emergent agent behavior. |

### Detailed breakdown

| Tool | Primary focus | Where Aerograph differs |
|---|---|---|
| `trigger.dev` | Reliable background job execution, durable task infrastructure, and operational recovery. | Aerograph does zero execution. While Trigger ensures the system runs, Aerograph traces why it ran that way - detecting loops and hallucinated agent handoffs. |
| `inngest.com` | Event-driven workflow engines, long-running functions, and event coordination. | Aerograph is a flight recorder, not an engine. Inngest acts as the execution backbone; Aerograph acts as the DevTools layer to inspect internal behavioral failure points. |
| `LangSmith` | LLM app tracing, prompt evaluation datasets, and production telemetry. | Aerograph is framework-agnostic cognitive debugging. Instead of linear log traces, Aerograph reconstructs multi-agent reasoning graphs, memory interactions, and decision paths in a replayable UI. |

## How This Project Is Split

This repository serves two different audiences:

- Contributors work in the monorepo and run the collector, web UI, demos, and tests locally.
- End users consume the reusable packages, usually `@aerograph/sdk`, `@aerograph/adapter-langchain`, `aerograph-sdk`, and `aerograph-langchain`, from their own application.

That split is intentional. The repo contains the product, but the public integration surface is the SDK and adapters. The collector and web UI are the viewing and storage layer that can be run locally or hosted separately.

## Deployment Model

There are two supported ways to ship AFR:

- **Self-hosted**: users run the collector and web UI themselves, then point their app at the collector endpoint.
- **Hosted**: you run the collector and web UI as a service, and users only install the SDK or adapter in their own project.

---

## TypeScript / Node.js Packages

AeroGraph provides native TypeScript libraries for capturing and validating traces.

### `@aerograph/contracts`
The single source of truth for all AeroGraph Event schemas using Zod. Use this package if you are building custom ingestion tools or new language SDKs that need schema validation in TypeScript.
```bash
npm install @aerograph/contracts
```

### `@aerograph/sdk`
The core Node.js Flight Recorder for emitting normalized trace events from any JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
```bash
npm install @aerograph/sdk
```
```typescript
import { FlightRecorder } from "@aerograph/sdk";

const recorder = new FlightRecorder({ endpoint: "http://localhost:4317", actor: { id: "agent-1" } });
await recorder.prompt({ text: "Hello!" });
```

### `@aerograph/adapter-langchain`
An automatic callback adapter for LangChain.js. Records prompts, tools, RAG queries, and multi-agent handoffs with zero boilerplate.
```bash
npm install @aerograph/adapter-langchain @aerograph/sdk
```
```typescript
import { AeroGraphCallbackHandler } from "@aerograph/adapter-langchain";
// Pass handler to your LangChain invocations
```

### `@aerograph/otel`
The bidirectional OpenTelemetry bridge. Export AeroGraph traces to OTLP JSON, or ingest external OTLP spans.
```bash
npm install @aerograph/otel
```

---

## Python Packages

AeroGraph ships two Python packages that mirror the TypeScript SDK in full, sharing the same contract schema and producing identical trace IDs and event shapes.

### `aerograph-sdk` - Core Python SDK

The foundational package. Gives you a `FlightRecorder` class that emits any of the 10 normalized event kinds to the AeroGraph collector, with both sync and async support.

#### Installation

```bash
pip install aerograph-sdk
# or with uv
uv add aerograph-sdk
```

Requirements: Python ≥ 3.10, `httpx ≥ 0.27`, `pydantic ≥ 2.0`

#### Quick Start

```python
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder

recorder = FlightRecorder(
    endpoint="http://localhost:4317",   # collector URL
    actor={"id": "my-agent", "name": "My Agent"},
)

# Emit a prompt and a linked response
prompt = recorder.prompt(parent_span_id=None, text="What is the weather in London?")
recorder.response(parent_span_id=prompt.spanId, text="It is currently 18 °C and cloudy.")
```

Both calls POST to `POST /v1/events` on the collector and return a validated Pydantic model. Open `http://localhost:5173` to see the trace.

#### Async Usage

Every convenience method has an `_async` twin for use inside async frameworks (FastAPI, LangGraph, etc.):

```python
import asyncio
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder

async def run():
    recorder = FlightRecorder(
        endpoint="http://localhost:4317",
        actor={"id": "async-agent"},
    )
    prompt = await recorder.prompt_async(parent_span_id=None, text="Hello!")
    await recorder.response_async(parent_span_id=prompt.spanId, text="World!")

asyncio.run(run())
```

#### All 10 Event Kinds

| Method | Event kind | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `recorder.prompt(...)` | `prompt` | LLM receives input text |
| `recorder.response(...)` | `response` | LLM produces output text |
| `recorder.tool_call(...)` | `tool_call` | Agent invokes a tool |
| `recorder.tool_result(...)` | `tool_result` | Tool returns its output |
| `recorder.handoff(...)` | `handoff` | One agent delegates to another |
| `recorder.error(...)` | `error` | Any exception or failure |
| `recorder.note(...)` | `note` | Free-form structured annotation |
| `recorder.state_snapshot(...)` | `state_snapshot` | Full state of a LangGraph node |
| `recorder.retriever(...)` | `retriever` | RAG retrieval with source docs |
| `recorder.checkpoint(...)` | `checkpoint` | Human-in-the-loop pause point |

Each async variant (`prompt_async`, `response_async`, `error_async`, …) has the identical signature.

#### Span Hierarchy

Events are linked into a tree through `parent_span_id`. The root event has `parent_span_id=None`. The `spanId` of every returned event can be passed as the `parent_span_id` of its children:

```python
root   = recorder.prompt(parent_span_id=None, text="Plan my trip to Tokyo")
call   = recorder.tool_call(parent_span_id=root.spanId,
                             tool_id="search", input={"q": "Tokyo flights"})
result = recorder.tool_result(parent_span_id=call.spanId,
                               tool_id="search", output={"url": "..."})
reply  = recorder.response(parent_span_id=root.spanId, text="Here is your plan…")
```

The UI renders this as a connected graph: `prompt → tool_call → tool_result` and `prompt → response`.

#### Batch Emission

Emit multiple pre-built events in one HTTP round-trip. Events are sorted deterministically (by `occurredAt → spanId → kind`) before dispatch:

```python
from aerograph_sdk.events import build_prompt_event, build_response_event

events = [
    build_prompt_event(trace_id=recorder.trace_id, actor_id="a1", text="q1"),
    build_response_event(trace_id=recorder.trace_id, actor_id="a1", text="r1"),
]
recorder.emit_batch(events)
# async: await recorder.emit_batch_async(events)
```

#### Span Context Manager

Use `recorder.span(...)` to generate a scoped span ID without emitting anything. Useful when you want to reserve an ID upfront and pass it through several functions:

```python
with recorder.span(parent_span_id=None) as ctx:
    recorder.prompt(span_id=ctx["span_id"], parent_span_id=None, text="…")
    recorder.response(parent_span_id=ctx["span_id"], text="…")

# Async variant:
async with recorder.async_span() as ctx:
    await recorder.prompt_async(span_id=ctx["span_id"], parent_span_id=None, text="…")
```

#### State Snapshot and Deterministic Hashing

`state_snapshot` computes a stable SHA-256 hash of your full state dict automatically, enabling the UI to detect identical states across forks:

```python
state = {"question": "What is Pi?", "step": 2, "done": True}
snap  = recorder.state_snapshot(
    parent_span_id=root.spanId,
    node_name="answerNode",
    full_state=state,
    # optional: pass state_diff and removed_keys for incremental diffs
)
print(snap.payload.stateHash)  # deterministic hex string
```

You can compute the hash independently for comparison:

```python
from aerograph_sdk import get_deterministic_state_hash, compute_state_diff

hash_a = get_deterministic_state_hash({"x": 1})
diff   = compute_state_diff(old_state, new_state)
```

#### Error Handling

`FlightRecorder` raises `EmissionError` (a subclass of `Exception`) when the collector returns a non-2xx status. Always wrap emissions when the collector may be unavailable:

```python
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder, EmissionError

recorder = FlightRecorder(endpoint="http://localhost:4317", actor={"id": "a1"})
try:
    recorder.prompt(parent_span_id=None, text="Hello")
except EmissionError as e:
    print(f"Collector rejected event: {e.status_code} - {e.body}")
```

#### Injecting a Custom HTTP Client

For testing or connection-pool reuse, inject your own `httpx.Client` / `httpx.AsyncClient`:

```python
import httpx
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder

with httpx.Client(timeout=5.0) as client:
    recorder = FlightRecorder(
        endpoint="http://localhost:4317",
        actor={"id": "a1"},
        http_client=client,
    )
    recorder.prompt(parent_span_id=None, text="…")
```

#### Stable Trace IDs

By default, `FlightRecorder` generates a fresh `trace_id` on construction. Supply your own to stitch events across multiple recorder instances or processes:

```python
from aerograph_sdk import new_trace_id

shared_id = new_trace_id()   # generate once, e.g. at request start

recorder_a = FlightRecorder(endpoint="…", actor={"id": "agent-a"}, trace_id=shared_id)
recorder_b = FlightRecorder(endpoint="…", actor={"id": "agent-b"}, trace_id=shared_id)
# All events land in the same trace in the UI
```

#### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Collector is down | `EmissionError` raised immediately; no retry by default. Wrap in try/except or add your own retry logic. |
| `parent_span_id=None` | Valid - marks a root event. Only one root per trace is recommended; the UI renders orphaned spans as disconnected nodes. |
| Duplicate `span_id` | The collector stores all events; the UI de-duplicates by `spanId` - the last write wins for display purposes. |
| Out-of-order emission | Events are displayed by `occurredAt`. If you emit response before prompt (e.g., due to async timing), the graph still renders correctly. |
| Very large payloads | The SDK does not chunk or compress. Keep individual event payloads under ~1 MB to avoid collector timeouts. |
| Cross-language traces | `trace_id` and `span_id` are plain strings - share them between Python and TypeScript recorders to merge multi-language agent traces in one graph. |

### `aerograph-langchain` - LangChain Callback Adapter

A zero-boilerplate adapter that hooks into LangChain's callback system and automatically records every LLM call, tool invocation, retriever run, and error as AeroGraph trace events - no manual emit calls required.

#### Installation

```bash
pip install aerograph-langchain
# or with uv
uv add aerograph-langchain
```

For local development from the repo root:

```bash
# Install core SDK first
pip install -e python/aerograph-sdk

# Then install the adapter
pip install -e python/aerograph-langchain
```

Requirements: Python ≥ 3.10, `aerograph-sdk ≥ 0.2.0`, `langchain-core ≥ 0.2.0`

#### Quick Start - Chat Model

```python
import asyncio
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder
from aerograph_langchain.handler import AeroGraphCallbackHandler

async def main():
    recorder = FlightRecorder(
        endpoint="http://localhost:4317",
        actor={"id": "my-agent", "name": "TravelPlanner"},
    )
    handler = AeroGraphCallbackHandler(recorder)
    model   = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

    response = await model.ainvoke(
        [HumanMessage(content="What are 3 fun things to do in San Francisco?")],
        config={"callbacks": [handler]},
    )
    print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Two events are emitted automatically: a `PromptEvent` when the model is called and a `ResponseEvent` when it returns.

#### Chains and LCEL Pipelines

Attach the handler at chain invocation level. LangChain propagates callbacks automatically to every sub-chain, model, tool, and retriever inside the chain:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Answer briefly: {question}")
chain  = prompt | ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

result = chain.invoke(
    {"question": "What is AeroGraph?"},
    config={"callbacks": [handler]},
)
```

#### RAG / Retriever Pipelines

Retriever events capture the query string, all returned source documents, and any metadata scores:

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(["AeroGraph records agent traces."], OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever   = vectorstore.as_retriever()

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    retriever=retriever,
)
result = qa_chain.invoke(
    {"query": "What does AeroGraph do?"},
    config={"callbacks": [handler]},
)
```

The UI shows a `RetrieverEvent` with the query and each retrieved chunk, linked to the parent `PromptEvent`.

#### LangGraph State Snapshots

For graphs built with LangGraph, emit state snapshots at node boundaries using LangChain's `dispatch_custom_event`:

```python
from langchain_core.callbacks import dispatch_custom_event
from aerograph_sdk import get_deterministic_state_hash, compute_state_diff

async def my_node(state: dict, config):
    new_state = {**state, "step": state.get("step", 0) + 1}

    await dispatch_custom_event(
        "langgraph_state_snapshot",
        {
            "node_name":    "my_node",
            "full_state":   new_state,
            "state_diff":   compute_state_diff(state, new_state),
            "removed_keys": [],
            # state_hash is computed automatically by the SDK
        },
    )
    return new_state
```

The handler captures these as `StateSnapshotEvent`s. The state hash is computed deterministically so the UI can highlight nodes where state diverged across forked traces.

#### Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

Emit a `CheckpointEvent` when your graph pauses for human approval:

```python
await dispatch_custom_event(
    "langgraph_checkpoint",
    {
        "checkpoint_id": "approval-1",
        "reason":        "Awaiting human review before booking flight",
        "state":         current_state,
    },
)
```

#### Automatic Event Mapping

| LangChain callback | AeroGraph event | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `on_llm_start` | `PromptEvent` | Captures prompt text and model name |
| `on_chat_model_start` | `PromptEvent` | Captures message list as text |
| `on_llm_end` | `ResponseEvent` | Includes TTFT and tokens/sec when streaming |
| `on_llm_new_token` | *(internal)* | Updates streaming telemetry counter only |
| `on_tool_start` | `ToolCallEvent` | Captures tool name and structured input |
| `on_tool_end` | `ToolResultEvent` | Captures tool output |
| `on_retriever_start` | *(buffered)* | Stores query until `on_retriever_end` |
| `on_retriever_end` | `RetrieverEvent` | Emits query + all source documents |
| `on_llm_error` | `ErrorEvent` | Exception message + traceback details |
| `on_tool_error` | `ErrorEvent` | Tool failure details |
| `on_chain_error` | `ErrorEvent` | Chain-level failure |
| `on_custom_event("langgraph_state_snapshot", …)` | `StateSnapshotEvent` | LangGraph node state |
| `on_custom_event("langgraph_checkpoint", …)` | `CheckpointEvent` | Human interrupt state |

#### Streaming Telemetry

When you use a streaming-enabled model, the adapter measures:

- **TTFT** (Time-to-First-Token): milliseconds from `on_llm_start` to the first `on_llm_new_token`.
- **Tokens/sec**: total tokens divided by total elapsed time.

These metrics are attached to the `ResponseEvent.payload.streamingTelemetry` field and visible in the UI's event inspector.

#### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Non-streaming models | `streamingTelemetry` is `null` on the `ResponseEvent` - no TTFT or tokens/sec. |
| `on_retriever_end` fires without a matching `on_retriever_start` | Event is silently dropped; the tracker only emits when it has the query context. |
| Multiple retrievers in one chain | Each retriever run is tracked independently by `run_id`. |
| `on_custom_event` with an unknown name | Silently ignored - only `langgraph_state_snapshot` and `langgraph_checkpoint` are handled. |
| Synchronous chain invocation (`chain.invoke`) | All callbacks fire synchronously; emissions block until the collector responds. Use async invocation (`ainvoke`) in latency-sensitive paths. |
| Handler shared across multiple `.invoke` calls | The same `trace_id` is reused. Each call appends to the same trace in the UI. Pass a fresh `AeroGraphCallbackHandler(recorder)` per invocation if you want separate traces. |
| Collector unavailable | `EmissionError` propagates out of the callback. LangChain will surface this as an unhandled exception in the callback chain. Wrap the collector call or use a resilient recorder if you need fire-and-forget. |

#### Multi-Agent Example

```python
from aerograph_sdk import FlightRecorder, new_trace_id
from aerograph_langchain.handler import AeroGraphCallbackHandler

# Share one trace across two agents
shared_trace = new_trace_id()

planner_recorder = FlightRecorder(
    endpoint="http://localhost:4317",
    actor={"id": "planner", "name": "Planner Agent"},
    trace_id=shared_trace,
)
executor_recorder = FlightRecorder(
    endpoint="http://localhost:4317",
    actor={"id": "executor", "name": "Executor Agent"},
    trace_id=shared_trace,
)

planner_handler  = AeroGraphCallbackHandler(planner_recorder,  trace_id=shared_trace)
executor_handler = AeroGraphCallbackHandler(executor_recorder, trace_id=shared_trace)

# Emit a handoff between agents
planner_recorder.handoff(
    from_agent_id="planner",
    to_agent_id="executor",
    reason="Plan complete, executing sub-tasks",
)

# Each agent's LangChain calls are now recorded in the same trace graph
await executor_chain.ainvoke(input, config={"callbacks": [executor_handler]})
```

#### Local Development & Testing

```bash
# Install both packages in editable mode (from repo root)
pip install -e python/aerograph-sdk
pip install -e python/aerograph-langchain

# Run SDK tests
cd python/aerograph-sdk && pytest

# Run adapter tests
cd python/aerograph-langchain && pytest
```

The test suites use `pytest-httpx` to mock the collector, so no running collector is required.

## Contributing

Welcome - contributions of all sizes are appreciated. Read this section carefully before opening a PR. The most important thing to understand is the **contract-first architecture** that governs every change across languages.

---

### The contract-first architecture

AeroGraph is a multi-language project. The TypeScript Zod schemas in `packages/contracts` are the **single source of truth** for every event shape, field name, validation rule, and sort/hash algorithm. Everything else is derived:

```
packages/contracts/src/index.ts   ← THE ONLY PLACE YOU DEFINE EVENT SHAPES
        │

python/aerograph-sdk/src/aerograph_sdk/contracts/generated.py   ← auto-generated Pydantic models
```

The Python Pydantic models (`generated.py`) are **never edited by hand**. They are regenerated from the JSON Schema artifacts every time the contracts change. CI enforces this: if the generated file is out of sync, the `python.yml` workflow fails.

The same deterministic hash and sort functions that exist in TypeScript are reimplemented in Python (`state_hash.py`, `events.py`) and validated by the `parity.yml` CI workflow against shared fixture files.

### Do I need to write code in both TypeScript and Python?

This depends entirely on what you are changing. Here is the exact rule:

| What you are changing | TypeScript work required | Python work required |
|---|---|---|
| **Event schema** - add/rename/remove a field or a new event kind | ✅ Edit `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` | ⚙️ Run codegen script - `generated.py` updates itself |
| **Collector logic** (ingest, storage, lineage, diff, loop detection) | ✅ Edit files under `apps/collector` | ❌ None |
| **Web UI** (graph, inspector, diff overlay) | ✅ Edit files under `apps/web` | ❌ None |
| **TypeScript SDK** convenience helpers | ✅ Edit `packages/sdk` | ❌ None - unless the helper exposes something user-facing that Python should also have |
| **New framework adapter** (e.g. AutoGen, CrewAI) | ✅ Create `packages/adapter-<name>` | ✅ Create `python/aerograph-<name>` mirroring the same behaviour |
| **Python SDK recorder logic** (a new convenience method, a helper) | ❌ None | ✅ Edit `python/aerograph-sdk` |
| **Python LangChain adapter** (a new callback, mapping, or fix) | ❌ None | ✅ Edit `python/aerograph-langchain` |
| **Hashing or sorting algorithm change** | ✅ Edit `packages/contracts/src/utils/hash.ts` and `compareTraceEvents` | ✅ Update `state_hash.py` and `events.py` to match, **and** update the parity fixtures |
| **Parity fixtures** | ✅ Update `packages/contracts/src/__fixtures__/parity/` | ✅ Update the Python equivalents |

**Summary:** Adding a new event kind or a field to an existing event requires one TypeScript edit + running two commands. Everything else is only one language.

### Workflow A - Adding or changing an event field

This is the most common schema-level contribution. Example: adding a `tokenCount` field to `ResponseEvent`.

**Step 1 - Edit the Zod contract (TypeScript only)**

```ts
// packages/contracts/src/index.ts
export const responsePayloadSchema = z.object({
  text: z.string(),
  tokenCount: z.number().int().nonnegative().optional(),   // ← add this
  streamingTelemetry: streamingTelemetrySchema.optional()
});
```

**Step 2 - Export the updated JSON Schema**

```sh
npm run schema:export -w packages/schema-exporter
```

This writes updated `.schema.json` files to `packages/schema-exporter/artifacts/`.

**Step 3 - Regenerate the Python Pydantic models**

```sh
uv run python/aerograph-sdk/tools/generate_contracts.py
```

This overwrites `python/aerograph-sdk/src/aerograph_sdk/contracts/generated.py`. Do **not** edit that file manually.

**Step 4 - Run all CI checks locally**

```sh
# TypeScript contracts + SDK tests
npm test

# Python SDK tests
cd python/aerograph-sdk && uv run pytest

# Python adapter tests
cd python/aerograph-langchain && uv run pytest
```

**Step 5 - Commit all changed files together**

Commit `index.ts`, the exported `.schema.json` files, and `generated.py` in the same commit. CI (`schema-governance.yml` and `python.yml`) will reject PRs where these are out of sync.

---

### Workflow B - Adding a new adapter (new framework)

Example: adding AutoGen support.

1. **Create `packages/adapter-autogen`** (TypeScript) following the same structure as `packages/adapter-langchain`. Use the TypeScript SDK (`packages/sdk`) to emit events via `FlightRecorder`.
2. **Create `python/aerograph-autogen`** (Python) following the same structure as `python/aerograph-langchain`. Use `aerograph-sdk`'s `FlightRecorder` to emit events.
3. Both adapters must emit the **same event kinds** for the same observable framework signals. Write integration tests in both.
4. No changes to `packages/contracts` are needed unless you need a new event kind (in which case follow Workflow A first).
5. Add entries for both packages to the **Repository structure** table in this README.

Adapters do **not** need to be feature-identical on day one - ship the TypeScript version first if you are more comfortable there, or Python first if you are a Python developer. Just open the PR clearly marked as partial and document which side is missing.

---

### Workflow C - Fixing a bug or adding a feature in the collector or web UI

The collector (`apps/collector`) and web UI (`apps/web`) are TypeScript/Node only. Python plays no role.

1. Make your changes under the relevant `apps/` directory.
2. Run `npm test` to verify the full test suite.
3. Start the collector and web UI locally to manually verify: `npm run dev -w apps/collector` + `npm run dev -w apps/web`.
4. No Python steps required.

---

### Workflow D - Python-only changes (recorder logic, helpers)

If you are only changing Python code that does **not** touch event schemas - for example, adding a new convenience method to `FlightRecorder`, fixing a bug in `streaming.py`, or improving error messages:

1. Edit the relevant file in `python/aerograph-sdk` or `python/aerograph-langchain`.
2. Add or update tests in the `tests/` directory of that package.
3. Run `uv run pytest` in the package directory.
4. No TypeScript steps required.

If your new convenience method wraps an existing event kind, no codegen is needed. If it exposes a **new** event kind or field, do Workflow A first.

### CI gates and what breaks them

Every PR runs four CI workflows. Here is what each one checks and the most common reason it fails:

| Workflow | What it checks | Common failure cause |
|---|---|---|
| `schema-governance.yml` | JSON Schema artifacts in `packages/schema-exporter/artifacts/` match the current Zod definitions in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` | You edited `index.ts` but forgot to run `npm run schema:export` |
| `python.yml` | `generated.py` matches the JSON Schema artifacts | You ran `schema:export` but forgot to run `generate_contracts.py`, or you edited `generated.py` by hand |
| `parity.yml` | Python hashing and event ordering produce the same output as TypeScript for the shared fixture inputs | You changed `compareTraceEvents` or `get_deterministic_state_hash` in one language but not the other, or the parity fixtures are stale |
| (standard) `npm test` | All TypeScript unit and integration tests pass | Normal test failure - fix the code or test |

All four must be green for a PR to be mergeable.

---

### Commit and PR conventions

- **Branch naming**: `feat/<short-description>`, `fix/<short-description>`, `docs/<short-description>`
- **Commit messages**: use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- **One concern per PR**: keep schema changes, implementation changes, and doc changes in separate PRs when possible
- **Generated files**: always commit `generated.py` and the `.schema.json` artifacts in the same commit as the `index.ts` change that produced them - never in a separate PR
- **Tests**: every new event kind, method, or adapter callback must have at least one unit test
- **CHANGELOG**: not required for PRs, but maintainers will tag releases and note changes

### Running everything locally

Full local setup from a clean clone:

```sh
# 1. Install Node dependencies (root + all workspaces)
npm install

# 2. Build contracts
npm run build -w packages/contracts

# 3. Start the collector
npm run dev -w apps/collector

# 4. In a second terminal, start the web UI
npm run dev -w apps/web

# 5. Install Python SDK in editable mode
pip install -e python/aerograph-sdk

# 6. Install Python LangChain adapter in editable mode
pip install -e python/aerograph-langchain

# 7. Run all TypeScript tests
npm test

# 8. Run Python SDK tests
cd python/aerograph-sdk && pytest

# 9. Run Python adapter tests
cd python/aerograph-langchain && pytest

# 10. Emit a demo trace (requires collector running)
npx tsx apps/demo/src/demo.ts
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to see the trace graph.

> **Tip - using `uv` for Python:** `uv` is the recommended Python package manager for this project. Replace `pip install -e` with `uv pip install -e` and `pytest` with `uv run pytest` if you prefer it. The codegen tool must be run with `uv run python/aerograph-sdk/tools/generate_contracts.py` specifically because `uv` manages the virtual environment and dependencies automatically.
